            <h2>Six Approaches to Psychology:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Psychoanalytic:</b> Focuses on the unconscious mind, dreams,
                and inner conflicts as determinants of behavior and mental
                processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Behavioral:</b> Examines observable behaviors and how they
                are influenced by stimuli and responses in the environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Gestalt:</b> Studies how people perceive and interpret the
                world as a whole, emphasizing patterns and context.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Humanistic:</b> Emphasizes personal growth,
                self-actualization, and the inherent goodness of individuals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cognitive:</b> Investigates mental processes such as
                thinking, memory, and problem-solving.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Biological:</b> Explores the biological basis of behavior,
                including genetics, brain structure, and neurotransmitters.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Scientific Approach:</h2>
            <p>
              Psychology uses a scientific approach to study behavior and mental
              processes. Key differences:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>True Experiment:</b> Manipulates variables to establish
                causation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Correlational Approach:</b> Examines relationships between
                variables without manipulation.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Key Figures in Psychology:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>William James:</b> Pioneer of functionalism, focusing on how
                mental processes function in adapting to the environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Wilhelm Wundt:</b> Founder of structuralism, the study of the
                basic elements of consciousness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Charles Darwin:</b> Influential in psychology for his ideas
                on natural selection and individual differences.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Sir Francis Galton:</b> Contributed to the study of
                individual differences. Cousin of Darwin.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>John Watson:</b> Known for behaviorism, emphasizing
                observable behaviors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Titchener:</b> Prominent in structuralism, studying the
                structure of consciousness.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Introspection:</h2>
            <p>
              A method where individuals reflect and report on their own
              thoughts, feelings, and sensations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Testable Hypothesis:</h2>
            <p>
              A hypothesis in science should be disconfirmable or falsifiable,
              meaning it can be tested to either support or refute it. Avoid
              offering explanations after observing results.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Random Assignment:</h2>
            <p>
              In true experiments, subjects are randomly assigned to groups to
              control for extraneous variables, ensuring that differences in the
              dependent variable are due to the independent variable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Random Sampling:</h2>
            <p>
              In research, a random selection of subjects helps create a sample
              that represents the larger population, allowing for the
              generalization of findings.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>True Experiments vs. Correlational Studies:</h2>
            <p>
              True experiments involve manipulation to establish causation,
              while correlational studies examine relationships without
              manipulation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Fields of Specialization:</h2>
            <p>
              Study various fields within psychology as outlined in the
              textbook.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Charles Darwin and Psychology:</h2>
            <p>
              Darwin's theory of natural selection highlighted the role of
              individual differences, which later led to the study of individual
              differences in psychology.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Ethics of Research:</h2>
            <p>
              Considerations include the Institutional Review Board (IRB),
              informed consent, minimizing harm, privacy, and debriefing of
              participants.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h2>Area Under the Normal Curve:</h2>
            <p>
              The phrase "Area Under the Normal Curve" means understanding the
              percentages associated with different standard deviations from the
              mean on a normal distribution curve, which are approximately 34%
              within one standard deviation, 14% within two standard deviations,
              2% within three standard deviations, and 0.13% beyond three
              standard deviations from the mean. This knowledge is essential for
              interpreting data and making statistical inferences in the context
              of a normal distribution.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Dependent and Independent Variables:</h2>
            <p>
              The dependent variable is what you measure, and the independent
              variable is what you manipulate in an experiment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics:</h2>
            <p>
              Descriptive statistics summarize data, while inferential
              statistics draw conclusions or make predictions based on data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Measures of Central Tendency and Spread:</h2>
            <p>
              Central tendency includes mean, median, and mode. Spread involves
              range, standard deviation, and variance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Manipulating a Variable:</h2>
            <p>
              To manipulate a variable means intentionally changing it to
              observe its effect on the dependent variable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Standard Deviation:</h2>
            <p>
              A measure of the spread or variability of data points in a
              dataset. It indicates how much individual data points differ from
              the mean.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Correlation:</h2>
            <p>
              It has magnitude (strength) and direction (positive or negative).
              A correlation of 0 means no relationship, while -0.95 is a strong
              negative correlation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Z-Score:</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
              <p style="line-height: 1.5">
                Also called standardized score, it allows the comparison of
                scores from different scales or units by converting them into a
                common scale.
                <br />
                <br />
                The formula for calculating a z-score is: <b>z = (x-μ)/σ</b>
                <br />Where: <b>x</b> is the raw score, <b>μ</b> is the
                population mean, and <b>σ</b> is the population standard
                deviation. For example, if you have a test score of 190, and the
                test has a mean of 150 and a standard deviation of 25, your z
                score would be: z = (190 – 150) / 25
              </p>

            <h2>Third Variable Problem and Directionality Problem:</h2>
            <p>
              These are issues in correlational studies that can make it tricky
              to figure out what's really causing what.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Third Variable Problem:</b> Imagine you see a link between
                two things, like ice cream sales and drownings. But the real
                reason might be a third thing, like hot weather, which makes
                people buy ice cream and swim more. So, it's not the ice cream
                causing drownings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Directionality Problem:</b> Sometimes, you know two things
                are related, but you're not sure which one comes first. Like, do
                happy people make more friends, or do having more friends make
                people happier? It's like a chicken-and-egg situation; it's hard
                to tell which came first.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These problems remind us that correlation doesn't always mean
              causation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Research Methods:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Surveys:</b> Surveys are like questionnaires. We ask people
                questions to collect information about their thoughts, feelings,
                or behaviors. It's like asking a bunch of people what they
                think.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Observational Method:</b> This is when we watch and take
                notes. We observe people or things to understand how they act or
                behave. It's like watching a soccer game and writing down what
                players do.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Case Studies:</b> Case studies are like detailed stories
                about one person or a small group. We study them closely to
                learn about specific situations or people. It's like reading a
                detailed biography about someone's life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Correlational Method:</b> This is about finding relationships
                between things. We see if two things are connected, like if
                studying more leads to better grades. It's like noticing that
                when it's sunny, more people go to the beach.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Experimental Method:</b> Experiments are like science tests.
                We change something on purpose to see how it affects something
                else. It's like testing if watering plants more makes them grow
                faster.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>True Experiment:</b> In true experiments, we carefully
                control everything to see if one thing causes another. We use
                groups of people and change one thing to check if it makes a
                difference. It's like testing if a new medicine really cures a
                sickness by giving it to one group and not the other.

            <h2>Neuron:</h2>
            <p>
              Understand its components, including dendrites (receive signals),
              soma (cell body), axon (transmits signals), terminal buttons
              (release neurotransmitters), and myelin sheath (insulation).

              <br />
              <b>• Motion Parallax:</b>

              Objects higher on your field of vision appear farther away.
              <br />
              <b>• Interposition:</b>
              When one object partially covers another, you perceive the covered
              object as closer.
              <br />
              <b>• Linear Perspective:</b>
              Parallel lines appear to converge or meet in the distance.
              <br />
              <b>• Aerial Perspective:</b>
              Distant objects look fuzzier and bluer due to the air between you

              <b>• Relative Brightness:</b>
              Brighter objects appear closer, and dimmer ones seem farther away.

              <b>• Texture Gradient:</b>
              Details on surfaces become less distinct with distance.
              <br />
              <b>• Shading:</b>
              The way light and shadows fall on objects helps your brain
              perceive their three-dimensional shape and depth.
